# Dogs Breeds Recognition with TensorFlow Lite

## Android Application For Dog Breed Classification with TensorFlow Lite

**ABSTRACT**

This project: includes an Android mobile application using TensorFlow Lite model trained with Stanford University Dogs Dataset consisting of 120 dog breeds and a total of 20580 images. In this application, the breed of any dog shown to the device using the camera of the mobile device are presented to the user with the similarity rate to the breed as well as the similarity rates to the other breeds. The user can also view and change how long the dog breed has been extracted takes by the application and how many threads occurs. At the same time, the processor load of the application can be changed between CPU and GPU from the user interface.
